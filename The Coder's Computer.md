## Important Text Editor features

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain andfatigue); and
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them

### Code Completion

Code Completion helps anticipate code and helps minimize mistakes and typos and can automatically complete code for you.

### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting color codes your code. Which makes it easier to read and help keep your code organized.

## Built in vs. Third party Text Editors

#### Whether you use a Mac, Windows, or Linux based compute they will each come with their own built in text editors. These are basic text editors with none of the feature mentioned above. No code completion, syntax highlighting, themes, or extensions. 

#### There are also a variety of third party Text editors including; Notepad++, TextWrangler, Visual Studio Code, BB Edit, Atom, and Brackets among others. These all have their own strengths and weaknesses and the one that works best for you is usually the best choice. For this course we will be using Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code includes: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion and is commonly used among web developers. 



### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain andfatigue); and
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them
What do the following commands do?

- pwd tells what your current directory is and where you are in the directory
- ls tells you what is in the current directory
- cd allows you to change directory or go back to your home directory
- mkdir creates a new directory
- touch creates a blank file

### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
cd projects
mkdir new-project
touch new-project/newfile.md
cd ..
ls projects/new-project

- in the scenario above, we are navigating to the projects directory, creating a new directory within projects, then creating a new file, and then navigating to that new-project file
