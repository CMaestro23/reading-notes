## Built in vs. Third party Text Editors

#### Whether you use a Mac, Windows, or Linux based compute they will each come with their own built in text editors. These are basic text editors with none of the feature mentioned above. No code completion, syntax highlighting, themes, or extensions. 

#### There are also a variety of third party Text editors including; Notepad++, TextWrangler, Visual Studio Code, BB Edit, Atom, and Brackets among others. These all have their own strengths and weaknesses and the one that works best for you is usually the best choice. For this course we will be using Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code includes: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion and is commonly used among web developers.
