# Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

### The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any link -element references to external CSS stylesheets and any script -element references to scripts.

### As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from link elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from script elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.

### The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.
