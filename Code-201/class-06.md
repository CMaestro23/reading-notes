# 1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

### an object starts with a word, and then uses a list of items that describe that object

# 2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?

### It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

# 3. How do objects differ from arrays?

### Array

### Array of objects

### Arrays are best to use when the elements are numbers.

### Objects are best to use when the elements’ strings (text).

### The data inside an array is known as Elements.

### The data inside objects are known as Properties which consists of a key and a value.

# 4.Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.

### if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.

# 5.Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

### this is referring to items inside the object. its succint, clear, and easy to understand what's being called. 


# 1.What is the DOM?

### The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page

# 2.Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

### Javascript uses the DOM to access the document and then modify the page

## Things I want to know more about

### I would like to understand better just how the DOM interacts with the page and how Javascript is accessing that information.
