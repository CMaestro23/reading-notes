# 1.Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

### It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

# 2.Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

### your flex direction sets the main axis and the cross axis is the opposite. So if the flex directions is set to horizontal the cross axis will be vertical. If the flex is set to vertical the cross axis will be horizontal.

# 3.How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

### Using the flex-direction property with values of row-reverse or column-reverse will create a disconnect between the visual presentation of content and DOM order. 

# 1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

### The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:

### Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent. Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available. Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
