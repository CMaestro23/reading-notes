# 1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

### members being able to speak roughly equally and contribute to the conversation, social sensitiviy, and creating an environment where everyone feels like they are contributing to the project. Nobody dominates the project, the conversation, or ideas. 

# 2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

### my previous role in clinical research was a pretty unhealthy workplace psychologically. Nobody in the office spoke to each other hardly at all and when we did it was whispered and with fear that we would be in trouble. There was definitely a tension aroud the place between employees and management -- and to be honest, that fear proved valid when they laid off a large number of employees.

# 3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

### teams like this create an atmosphere where team members are engaged, invested, and committed to the company they work for in a long term sense. It gets employees out of thinking strictly about themselves/their career and has them focusing on producing good work and contributing to the company.
