# 1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

### It helps communicate the plan or strategy for the page. So that others involved with the project can understand the project and what's being done.

# 2. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

### html tables can reduce accessibilty, make for unclear code thats harder for the browser to read and tey are not automatically responsive

# 3. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

### thead - similar to the head in html it contains the title for the table and information about the table - tr -- table row creates rows for the table, and tbody - contains body elements for the table

# 4. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

### A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:
### create a new object
### bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code
### run the code in the constructor
### return the new object.

# 5. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

### In an object literal, the this keyword refers to the object being defined or constructed. It represents the object that the method or property is attached to.

### In the context of a constructor function, the this keyword refers to the newly created instance of an object. Constructors are used to create and initialize objects of a specific class

# Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
# NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

### my analogy would be a prototype is a department that uses a new method of solving a problem and is succesful and then other departments inherit or adopt that method to solve the problem in their area.
