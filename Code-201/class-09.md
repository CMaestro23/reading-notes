# 1. Why are forms so important in web development?

### forms are the main point of interaction for a user and the website/page. It can also be an opportunity to gather more information about the use, which for business applications can be critical.

# 2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

### Keep it simple and stay focused: ask only for the data you absolutely need.

# 3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

### the FORM element is that starting point of all forms so it's important for labeling and identifying what you're doing at that poing on the page. -- similarly the LABEL element serves as another identifier of what the information being put in is -- the INPUT element is where the user is putting in information and going along with that is the TYPE element which further identifies what type fof input that user is putting into the form. -- the BUTTION element in my view is one of the most important parts of a form, because the use is going to want to know their information is being submitted, the button function operating correctly gives that confirmation and satisfaction to the user. 

# 1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

### bubbling comes from the innermost element. whereas capturing catches the specific click on the button or element
