# 1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

### Syntax errors are typically spelling or text errors that cause the program to be unable to run correctly. 
### Logic errors are issues with the programming that cause it to run different than intended. The page may still work, but won't work correctly.

# 2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

### A few have been where I've spelled a word differently in one element/object than another. salmonCookie vs salmonCookies for example. I guess more of a logic error was where my code was running the store sales for the Salmon Cookies Lab twice. I had ran the function more than once and had to comment it out. 

# 3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

### I've definitely learned to pay attention to detail, to make sure the naming of elements make sense so it's easier to keep track of.

# 1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

### I would describe it as like being able to have a controller for your code to play it in slow motion to see errors as they happen. It allows you to pinpoint the errors specifically and go in to correct them.

# 2. Define what a breakpoint is.

### it's where the code can be stopped to examine the code and make sure it's working properly

# 3. What is the call stack?

### call stack is essentially the order that the browser executes the code on the page. it allows you to see what's being run and what will run next
