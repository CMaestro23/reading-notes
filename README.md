**Growth mindset is about continually working and being disciplined to push through the difficult parts of learning. Learning to be okay with being bad at something until you are good at it. Sometimes that means doing it poorly repeatedly, until you have that breakthrough of doing it well.**
<sub> Four years ago we moved to a house with some land in the country. I was not at all handy then when we moved here. But in the past few months I have remodeled our pantry and laundry room and the ability to do that came from 4 years of working on different projects and getting better. Now I am competent and can do much more than before. That is an example of growth mindset, I let myself fail many times and continue to. But I get better with each failure.</sub>
